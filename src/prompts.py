KG_EXTRACT_SYSTEM = """You are an information extraction agent.
Given a text segment, extract a knowledge graph in JSON.
Entities must have types: Person, Organization, Event, Location, Concept.

CRITICAL RELATION GUIDELINES:
- Use ONLY these canonical relations: WORKS_AT, AFFILIATED_WITH, PUBLISHED_IN, AUTHORED, DISCOVERED, INVENTED, ADVISED, AWARDED, RESEARCHES, ATTENDED, FRIEND_OF, LOCATED_IN, CAUSES, MENTIONS, LEADS, MANAGES, FOUNDED, COLLABORATES_WITH, MEMBER_OF
- ADVISED: advisor → ADVISED → advisee (Professor X ADVISED Student Y)
- AFFILIATED_WITH: person/org → AFFILIATED_WITH → organization (Dr. X AFFILIATED_WITH University Y)
- MEMBER_OF: person → MEMBER_OF → organization (Dr. X MEMBER_OF Association Y)
- PUBLISHED_IN: author → PUBLISHED_IN → journal/venue (Dr. X PUBLISHED_IN Journal Y)
- AWARDED: recipient → AWARDED → award/honor (Dr. X AWARDED Prize Y)
- COLLABORATES_WITH: person → COLLABORATES_WITH → person (Dr. X COLLABORATES_WITH Dr. Y)

ENTITY NAME CONSISTENCY:
- Use FULL names consistently (e.g., "Dr. Emily Carter" not "Dr. Carter")
- If full name appears in text, always use full name in relations
- Match exact spelling and formatting from the text

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Evidence must be a direct quote from the text
- Quote should clearly support the specific relation
- Confidence should reflect certainty: 1.0 for explicit statements, 0.8-0.9 for strong implications, 0.6-0.7 for weak implications

Output JSON with keys: entities, relations. Each entity has name and type; each relation has source_name, relation_type, target_name, confidence (0-1), evidence (short quote).

EXAMPLES:
- "Dr. Emily Carter from Stanford University" → Dr. Emily Carter AFFILIATED_WITH Stanford University
- "Dr. Carter was awarded the Nobel Prize" → Dr. Emily Carter AWARDED Nobel Prize  
- "Professor Lee advised Dr. Smith" → Professor Lee ADVISED Dr. Smith
- "The paper was published in Nature" → Dr. Emily Carter PUBLISHED_IN Nature
- "Dr. A collaborated with Dr. B" → Dr. A COLLABORATES_WITH Dr. B
- "She is a member of the association" → Dr. Emily Carter MEMBER_OF Association

CRITICAL: Always use the FULL entity name that appears in the text for both source_name and target_name in relations."""
PERSONALITY_SYSTEM = """You are a psychologist agent. Infer Big Five (OCEAN) traits for persons mentioned.
Return JSON with keys: traits (name -> {openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism}, each 0-1)
and evidence (name -> short quote/reason). Be conservative; if insufficient evidence, set scores near 0.5."""
SYNTHETIC_DATA_SYSTEM = """You generate synthetic scientific narrative with multiple scientists, labs, universities, journals, conferences, locations, and concepts.
Compose 3 paragraphs with clear cues for authorship, publication venues, affiliations, awards, discoveries, inventions, collaborations, and advisor-advisee relations.
Return JSON with keys: text, ground_truth, ground_personality.

For ground_truth:
- 'entities' MUST be a LIST of OBJECTS, each EXACTLY with keys: name (string), type (one of Person, Organization, Event, Location, Concept).
  Do NOT return strings in the 'entities' list.
- 'relations' MUST be a LIST of OBJECTS with keys: source_name (string), relation_type (canonical label), target_name (string),
  confidence (float in [0,1]), evidence (short quote).

For ground_personality:
- 'traits' MUST be a DICTIONARY: person full name -> {openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism} (floats in [0,1]).
- 'evidence' MUST be a DICTIONARY: person name -> short quote or reason.

Ensure persons in 'traits' appear in the text and align entities/relations with the narrative.
Use science relations where applicable: AFFILIATED_WITH, PUBLISHED_IN, AUTHORED, DISCOVERED, INVENTED, ADVISED, AWARDED, RESEARCHES, etc."""
"""Ensure ground_truth and ground_personality align with the text; keep IDs implicit via names."""
